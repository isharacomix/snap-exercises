<p>If you still have time left in the lab, try playing with blocks that you haven't seen before. A good place to start would be the <b>blue move blocks</b>. Remember, you can test out a block by just clicking it once. This is a good way to teach yourself what a block does. When you understand a block, imagine how you might use it in a bigger program like a drawing or an animation.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy Snap! Remember, ask your instructors if there's still anything you don't understand, and work with your classmates so that you can learn together!</p>
