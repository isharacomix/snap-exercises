<p>We've given you a new block to try out.</p>

<p>To start an animation, click the green flag button at the top of the stage. When the green flag is clicked, all of the blocks that are snapped to the block with the rounded top will be executed. Try connecting your script from the last step to this new block.<p>

<p>Now try reading the program from top to bottom:

<blockquote>When the green flag is pressed, move 10 steps, and then turn to the right by 15 degrees.</blockquote>

Whenever you write a program, the computer will execute all of the blocks, in order, one at a time. Even very complicated programs follow this very simple rule. When you finish, check your answer and go on to the next page. If the answer is too small or runs off the screen, just click on the answer to zoom in.</p>
