<p>Each time new blocks are added, look at their names and think about how they might be used.</p>

<p>We're going to draw a square now. To make a sprite draw a line, use the <b>pen down</b> block, and then move the sprite. If you mess something up, the <b>clear</b> block will erase any lines you've drawn. It's possible to just put the blocks down and run them one at a time, but to complete this lab, you should <i>write a program that draws a square whenever the green flag is pressed</i>.</p>

<p>Try to figure out how to do this on your own using the blocks we've given you. If you get stuck, don't feel bad about checking the answer, but if you do, be sure to copy and run the code for yourelf and make sure you understand why it works. <i>If you don't understand the answer, you should ask your teacher before you continue.</i> Keep in mind that there is often more than one answer, because your square might be bigger or smaller than the one in the answer.</p>
