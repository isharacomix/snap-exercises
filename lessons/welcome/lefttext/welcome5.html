<p>Whenever you do labs, we try to keep the interface simple so that you don't get confused by all of the blocks that Snap has. Snap has over 100 blocks, and you can even make your own! This is what the <b>full interface</b> looks like.</p>

<p>The biggest difference is the <b>corral</b>. You may have noticed that your <b>pen down</b> and <b>change color</b> blocks have vanished! That's because in the full interface, the corral groups blocks into <b>folders</b>. The color of each block gives you an idea of which folder it comes from and what it does. The blue blocks are related to <i>moving sprites</i>, while the teal blocks are related to <i>drawing with the pen</i>. In this class, you'll see blocks from all of the folders and what kinds of things they can do.</p>

<p>To save your work, click on the button at the top of the corral that looks like a piece of paper and choose "Export" project. A new window will pop up. In that window, go to <b>File -> Save Page As...</b> and change the name of the file to <b>yourname_lab1.xml</b>. Now find that file on your computer - it might be in your Downloads folder. If you need help finding it, ask your instructor to help you. <i>It's important to learn how to save your work now so that you can do it for all future labs and projects.</i></p>
