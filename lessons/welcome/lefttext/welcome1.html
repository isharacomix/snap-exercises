<p>A program in SNAP is made up of <b>Blocks</b>. To write a program, you drag blocks from the <b>Corral</b> on the left into the <b>Script Window</b> to the right. As you can see, the blocks look like puzzle pieces. If you line up the puzzle pieces, the two blocks will <b>snap</b> together, creating a <b>Script</b>.</p>

<p>If you want to know what a block or a script does, just quickly click the block or script one time. To complete this lab:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag the two blocks to the script area. Click on them to see what happens.</li>
<li>Snap the blocks together. Click on the script to see what happens.</li>
<li>Click on "show answer" and create the script displayed there.</li>
<li>After seeing the answer, click on the green "Next" button in the top right to move on to the next part of the lab.
</ul>
