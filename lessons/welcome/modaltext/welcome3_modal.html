<p>Now let's try drawing something.</p>

<p>Every sprite is able to draw a picture using something called the <b>pen</b>. When you put the pen down and move the sprite, a trail will be left behind. When you're done drawing, you can pick the pen up and move the sprite out of the way so you can see your picture</p>
