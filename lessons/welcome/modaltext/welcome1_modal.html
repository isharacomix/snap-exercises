<p>Welcome to SNAP! Snap is a visual programming language. Unlike programming languages that require you to type out code, Snap works by dragging blocks that look like puzzle pieces from the <b>Corral</b> to the <b>Script Window</b>.

In this lab exercise, you will learn how to create programs and save them to your computer so that you can send them to your teacher. Follow the instructions on each page, and we'll create a very simple program.</p>
