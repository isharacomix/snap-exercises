<p>Congratulations! You've finished the first Snap lab and hopefully understand the basics of how to use snap, where to find blocks, and how to save your work! This is a big first step, and it's important to understand that <i>all across computing, there are basic patterns that you can use to make it easier to learn new things on your own</i>.</p>

<p>For example, now that you know that blocks are color-coded, if you see a new block that's blue, you know that you can find it in the "move" folder and that it probably moves or rotates a sprite on the screen. People who become good at programming don't memorize every single tool, they just learn the basic patterns and work from there.</p>

<p>If you've finished ahead of your classmates, you can keep playing in Snap or ask your teacher if you can help your friends. We have decided to show you all of the blocks that Snap has so you can play around with them, but if it's overwhelming, you can go back to a previous lesson to just work with the blocks you've already learned. Remember, if you make something cool, save it so that you can show it off later!</p>
