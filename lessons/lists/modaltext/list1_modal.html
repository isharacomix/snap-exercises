<p>In this exercise, we're going to take variables to the next level.</p>
<p>Lists are collections of multiple variables. Imagine if you were trying to write a program that needed to keep track of the names of 100 students - you wouldn't want to make a variable for each one! In this lesson, we're going to create our first list and use loops to handle the data in those lists.</p>
