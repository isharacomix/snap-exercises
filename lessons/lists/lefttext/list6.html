<p>Task: Bring it all together.</p>

<p>The goal of the final program is to do the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ask the user for an animal starting with 'A'</li>
    <li>Ask the user for an animal starting with 'B'</li>
    <li>Ask the user for an animal starting with 'C'</li>
    <li>Say all of the animals that the user has entered</li>
</ul>

<p>To say all of the animals, you should use a loop. Below is the pseudocode for the loop. Pseudocode is a way of expressing a programming language that gives a general idea of how to write a program without telling them exactly how to place the blocks. It's almost impossible to give examples of how to write larger programs without using it, so now is a good time for you to learn it!</p>

<pre>
counter = 0
repeat until counter = length of list
    say the counterth element of list
    change counter by 1
</pre>
