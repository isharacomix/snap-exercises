<p>Task: Create a list</p>

<p>Creating 26 variables is ridiculous, so we're going to create ONE variable to store the animal names: a list.</p>

<p>To create a list, first create a variable (we're calling ours "All Animals"), and then set it equal to the list block. Since 'all animals' is a list, we can <i>add</i> other variables to it. After getting the user's answer, add it to the list instead of saving it in a variable.</p>
