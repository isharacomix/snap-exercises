<p>Task: Save the answer in a variable</p>

<p>Our goal is to get the user to provide an animal for each letter of the alphabet. However, the 'answer' variable is overwritten every time the user answers a question. This means we need to store the answers in variables. Create a variable to store the animal's name, save 'answer' in that variable, and use that answer when you respond to the user.</p>
