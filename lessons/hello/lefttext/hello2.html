<p>TASK: Ask their name and tell them 'Hello name'</p>

<p>The last program is still in the script area. Let us clear the script area. Left click on the top tan <i>command</i> block; drag the whole program to the left into the palette; release it and it should disappear. </p>

Let us write the next program.
<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the tan <i>command</i> block labeled "when clicked".</i> 
<li>Drag and drop the green <i>command</i> block labeled "clear" and snap to the "when clicked" block.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the blue <i>command</i> block labeled "ask" and snap it to the "clear" block. This block will ask the user their name. The name they enter will be saved in the <i>reporter</i> block labeled "answer" </li>
<li>Drag and drop the purple <i>command</i> block labeled "say" and snap it to the "ask" block. We now need to change that block to say hello to the user.</i>
<li>Drag the green <i>reporter</i> block labeled "join" and place it right on top of the word "Hello!" in the "say" block. The block should now look like ... <i>say join hello world for 2 secs</i>. If you accidentally put the "join" block on top of the "2" then your block will be wrong and look like <i>Say Hello for join hello world secs.</i> To fix that just drag the "join" block left until it is over the word "Hello!"</li>
<li>We now replace the word "world" with the name the user entered. Drag the blue <i>reporter</i> block labeled "answer" and place it right on top of the word "world". The block should now look like ... <i>say join hello answer for 2 secs</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you wish to compare your program to the expected program, click on "Show me the answer". You can make changes to your program until they match.</p> 

<p>Try your program by clicking on the top tan <i>command</i> block. A rectangluar shaped area will appear at the bottom of the stage. Type your name into that area and then press Enter.</p>
