<p>The Snap interface is divided into folders that contain blocks with similar behavior. </p>

<p>For example, all of the blocks related to movement are in the movement folder, and all of the blocks related to the sprite's appearance are in the looks folder.</p>

<p>Feel free to experiment.</p>
