<p>Task: Display "Hello World"</p>

To the right of this text are SNAP blocks. They are in an area called the palette. If you left click on a block, you can drag it into the script area (the slightly gray area to the right of the blocks). The blocks will snap together in the script area to create a program.
</p> 

<ol>
<li> Drag and drop, into the script area, the tan <i>command</i> block labeled "when clicked". This will start your program. 
<li>Drag and drop the green <i>command</i> block labeled "clear" that will clear the screen (also called the stage). The stage is where the program will display its output. Make sure the top of the "clear" block touches the bottom of the "when clicked" block. In other words ... snap them together.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the purple <i>command</i> block labeled "say" that will say our message and snap it to the "clear" block. Note that it currently will say "Hello!". Place your mouse cursor after "Hello" (in the white space) and change the phrase to "Hello World"</li>
<li>Click on the top tan <i>command</i> block to test the code. The phrase "Hello World" should appear in the stage.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you wish, click on "show answer" to check your answer.</p>

<p>Congratulations ... you have written your first program.</p> 

<p>Click on Next (the green block at the top right of the screen) to move on to the next part of the exercise.</p>
