<p>Task: Display "Hello World"</p>

<p>Our first program isn't going to be anything fancy - it's just a simple greeting from the computer to you. All of our programs will start off small, but we'll make them more and more complicated with time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear the screen</li>
<li>Say "Hello World"</li>
<li>Click on the flag block to test the code</li>
</ul>

<p>When you think you've got it, click on "show answer" to check your answer. Then click on Next to move on to the next exercise.</p>
