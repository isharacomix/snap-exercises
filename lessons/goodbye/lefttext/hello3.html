<p>TASK: Draw a triangle</p>

<p>The triangle shape in the window is called a <i>sprite</i>. If you use the 'pen' block, then whenever the sprite moves, it will draw a line behind it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the 'pen down' block to start drawing</li>
<li>Use the 'move' block to move the arrow in the direction it's pointing.</li>
<li>Use the 'turn' block to rotate the arrow (remember, there are 360 degrees in a circle)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you're done, check your answer. Your answer might be different from the one we provide, but that's OK as long as you're drawing a triangle.</p>
